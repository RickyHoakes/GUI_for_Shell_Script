# GUI_for_Shell_Script

Usually shell interpreter looks like normal command prompt and we cant clearly segregate the useful command with the errors, so we want to built a graphical user interface through which the user enters commands, and result is shown and error shown in red color separately, like usual ide's.
This will be helpful for using simple shell commands ,basic arithmetical operations and listing out the directories, this can also compile and run various programs of all programming languages.
Introduction

we used python 3.8 IDE for python(VISUAL STUDIO, PyCharm, ATOM, Sublime, etc..
for implementing this shell interpreter

# modules we used in the source code
▷ OS ▷ Subprocess ▷ shelex ▷ sys ▷ tkinter ▷ PIL ▷ PyAutoGui module ▷ PySimpleGUI 4.39.1 module.

# Various features of GUI shell interpreter.

->buttons are eazy than to type commands
